# Sounding The World

* `train.py` is the main engine for the project.
* Adapt configuration in `config.py` (defaults) and `config.yml` (experiments)
* Adapt data loading in `data_loading.py`

All other interesting stuff goes in `lib/`:
* Add models to `lib/models/`
* Add loss functions to `lib/loss_functions.py`
* Adapt plotting in `lib/plotting.py`
